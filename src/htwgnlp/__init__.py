"""HTWG NLP Course Package


The `htwgnlp` package contains code for the HTWG NLP lecture and assignments. To locate all
code parts to be implemented for an assignments, search for the corresponding assignment
number (0-4) using `TODO ASSIGNMENT-X` as a search term.
Test the code by running `make assignment-x` command from the root directory of the project.

Assignments:
