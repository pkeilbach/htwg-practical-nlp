"""HTWG NLP Course Package

This is an empty __init__.py file to make Python treat the directory as a package.

The `htwgnlp` package contains code for the HTWG NLP lecture and assignments. To locate all
code parts to be implemented for an assignments, search for the corresponding assignment
number (0-4) using `ASSIGNMENT-X` as a search term.
Test the code by running `make assignment-x` command from the root directory of the project.

Assignments:

    Assignment 0: Introduction to Python
        A basic introduction to Python, covering programming concepts and language features.
        File: python_basics.py

    Assignment 1: Preprocessing
        Introduction to text preprocessing, covering tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
        File: preprocessing.py

    Assignment 2: Text Classification
        A basic introduction to classification, covering logistic regression and feature extraction.
        Files: features.py, logistic_regression.py

    Assignment 3: Naive Bayes
        Experience with key concepts such as word frequency calculation, Laplace smoothing, log likelihoods, and predictive probabilities.
