# Presentations

During the semester, each student should give a presentation about an NLP-related topic.

The presentation is ungraded, but mandatory to pass the course.

## Topic

The presentation can be about a tool, framework, technology, or just anything that you are interested in, as long as it fits into the broader context of NLP.

The idea is that you can explore an exciting NLP topic, hack around with some new framewrok, and share your findings with the class.

You can find the **list of topics** in the GitHub issues when filtering for the [`presentations`](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/labels/presentations) label.

If you are interested in a topic, you can add yourself as an **assignee** to the issue.

We will discuss the topic assignments in one of the first lectures.

!!! tip

    You can also **suggest your own topic**. If you do so, please create a new issue using the issue template for [Presentation Topic Suggestion](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/issues/new/choose), and **add both yourself and me as an assignee.** This will give me the chance to review your suggested topic.

!!! note

    If multiple students are interested in the same topic, we will figure out a way to assign the topics fairly.
    In case of doubt, a first-come-first-serve approach may be applied, so it's probably a good idea to be quick! 😉

## Scope

The scope of the presentation should be around **15-20 minutes** and you should include a **demo or practical example**.

For the **demo**, try to aim for 30-50% of the time (depending on the topic). Feel free to use any tool you want. You can show something in the browser, use Postman or Jupyter notebooks, or do some live hacking on the command line. 🤓

Besides that, there are no strict rules about the presentation format. You can use slides if you want, but it is not mandatory.

## Presentation Dates

We will discuss the dates of the presentations in one of the first lectures.

## Submission

You **don't need to submit** the presentation slides, but you need to submit the code of your practical part.

This should be in a format that is **directly executable** with a setup that is self-explanatory and follows common conventions (e.g. `npm start`).

It is recommended to provide your code as a GitHub repository that I can clone.

!!! example

    Here are some examples of what I mean:

    - If your practical part is a Jupyter Notebook, you could provide a [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/) link.
    - If you build a web service, after I cloned the repository, the service should come up by running `make` or `npm install && npm start`.
    - You could also provide a docker image that I can start with `docker run`.
    - If you provide a Python script, it is acceptable to do a `pip install` followed by a `python my_script.py`, since this is conventional in Python.
