# Presentations

During the semester, each student should give a **presentation about an NLP tool**, frameork, or related topic.
The idea is that you can explore an exciting NLP technology, play around with it and share your findings with the class.
There are no strict rules, but you should cover the technological aspects with relation to NLP and give a **demo or practical example**.

Maybe you can think of it as if you were part of a software engineering team working on an NLP project, and your task is to evaluate if a specific technology is suitable for the project and share your findings with the team.
After your presentation, every team member should have a good understanding of the technology and its capabilities.

## General Information

Here are some general information about the presentations:

- The presentation is **ungraded**, but it is mandatory to pass the course. 📈
- You can select a **topic** from the topic list or suggest your own topic. 💡
- The scope of the presentation should be around **15-20 minutes**. 🧑‍🏫
- For the **demo**, try to aim for 30-50% of the time (depending on the topic). Feel free to use any tool you want. You can show something in the browser, use Postman or Jupyter notebooks, or do some live hacking on the command line. 🤓
- Since this is an NLP course, it is totally acceptable to use LLMs or GenAI to generate the content for your presentation. If you do so, please share your experiences at the end of the presentation! 🤖

## Topics and Dates

You can find the list of topics in the GitHub issues when filtering for the `presentation topic` label.

If you are interested in a topic, please add yourself as an assignee to the issue.

Remember that you can also suggest your own topic. If you do so, please create a new issue and add the `presentation topic` label.

If multiple students are interested in the same topic, we will figure out a way to assign the topics fairly.
In case of doubt, a first-come-first-serve approach may be applied, so it's probably a good idea to be quick! 😉

As for the dates, we will discuss them in one of the first lectures.

## Submission

In addition to the verbal presentation, the student should submit a **blog-like article** about the topic based on this [Markdown template](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/blob/main/docs/presentations/template.md). 📝

Please make sure the article is short and crisp. There are no hard rules, but maybe a reading time of not more than 10 minutes is a good approximation. ⏳

You **don't need to submit** any presentation **slides** or other assets from your verbal presentation. 📊
