# Presentations

During the semester, each student should give a **presentation about an NLP tool**, frameork, or related topic.
The idea is that you can explore an exciting NLP technology, play around with it and share your findings with the class.

Maybe you can think of it as if you were part of a software engineering team working on an NLP project, and your task is to evaluate if a specific technology is suitable for the project and share your findings with the team.
After your presentation, every team member should have a good understanding of the technology and its capabilities.

There are two parts to the presentation:

1. A **verbal presentation** in the lecture, including a **demo or practical example**
2. A **blog article** about the topic

Both of them are ungraded, but they are mandatory to pass the course.

!!! note

    Since this is an NLP course, it is totally acceptable to use **LLMs or GenAI** to generate the content for your presentation. If you do so, please share your experiences at the end of the presentation! ü§ñ

## Verbal Presentation

The scope of the verbal presentation should be around **15-20 minutes** and you should include a **demo or practical example**. üßë‚Äçüè´

For the **demo**, try to aim for 30-50% of the time (depending on the topic). Feel free to use any tool you want. You can show something in the browser, use Postman or Jupyter notebooks, or do some live hacking on the command line. ü§ì

Besides that, there are no strict rules about the presentation format. You can use slides if you want, but it is not mandatory. üìä

!!! info "Submission"

    You **don't need to submit** any presentation **slides** or other assets from your verbal presentation.

    You only need to submit the **blog article** (see below).

## Blog Article

In addition to the verbal presentation, the student should submit a **blog-like article** about the topic based on this [Markdown template](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/blob/main/docs/presentations/articles/template.md). üìù

!!! info "Markdown"

    If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can find a quick guide [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), or check out the official [Markdown specification](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Keep the article short and crisp. There are no hard rules, but maybe a **reading time** of not more than **10 minutes** is a good approximation. ‚è≥

The article should be written in **English**. :gb:

You have the following options to **submit the article**: üì¨

### Submission via Pull Request

This is the preferred way to submit the article. ü§ì

1.  **Add your aricle to the repository**

    Please add your article to the `docs/presentations/articles/` folder and name it `your_topic.md`. Please use [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) for the file name.

    !!! info "Assets"

        If you want to use images in your article, please try to include them from public sources like Wikipedia or Wikimedia Commons. Please make sure to include the link in a separate reference section to avoid licensing issues.

        In Markdown, you can include images like this:

        ```md
        ![alt text](https://example.com/image.png)
        ```

        In case you need to include images or other assets as files (e.g. a diagram you created by yourself), please add them to the `docs/presentations/articles/assets/` folder.

        Please use [kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab_case) for the asset file names, and prefix them with the topic name, e.g. `your-topic-image.png`.

        From your markdown file, you can then reference the assets like this:

        ```md
        <!-- the relative link is important -->
        ![alt text](./assets/your-topic-image.png)
        ```

2.  **Include the article in the `mkdocs.yml` file**

    You need to add the article to the `mkdocs.yml` file so that it is included in the generated website. Please append it to the `Articles` section like this:

    ```yaml
    nav:
      - Presentations:
          - presentations/presentations.md
          - Articles:
              - Article Template: presentations/articles/template.md
              - <your topic>: presentations/articles/your_topic.md
    ```

3.  **Push your changes to the remote repository**

    After you have added the article to the repository, you need to push your changes to the remote repository.

    ```sh
    git checkout -b presentation-your-topic
    git add docs/presentations/articles/
    git commit -m "Add blog article for <your topic>"
    git push -u origin presentation-your-topic
    ```

    !!! warning

        Please make sure to only add your article and related assets to the commit.

4.  **Create a pull request to the `main` branch**

    Finally, create a [pull request](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/pulls) to the `main` branch of the repository.

    !!! tip "Shortcut üí´"

        Usually, after pushing your branch to the remote repository, GitHub will already **suggest** you to create a pull request via a "Compare & pull request" banner.

    Please add the `presentation topic` label to your pull request, and add me as a reviewer.

    !!! note "Pull Requests ‚úÖ"

        If you are not familiar with GitHub and pull requests, this is a great opportunity to learn about it!
        It is a very common workflow in software development, and you will probably encounter it in your future career.

        You can find a quick guide [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and learn more about pull requests [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

    !!! warning "Publishing üì£"

        If you submit via pull request, you implicitly agree to publish the article on the course website. However, feel free to remove the author information if you don't want to be named.

### Submission via Email

Alternatively, you can just send me the markdown file via [email](mailto:pascal.keilbach@htwg-konstanz.de).

If you choose this way, please let me know if it is OK to publish the article on the course website.

If you include any assets, like images, please attach them to your email.

!!! info "Submission Deadline üìÖ"

    The article does not need to be submitted on the same day as the presentation. You can submit it later, but please make sure to submit it before the **end of the semester** (the exact date will be announced).

## Topics and Dates

You can find the **list of topics** in the GitHub issues when filtering for the [`presentation topic` label](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22presentation+topic%22).

If you are interested in a topic, please add yourself as an **assignee** to the issue.

You can also suggest your **own topic**. If you do so, please create a new issue and add the `presentation topic` label.

If multiple students are interested in the same topic, we will figure out a way to assign the topics fairly.
In case of doubt, a first-come-first-serve approach may be applied, so it's probably a good idea to be quick! üòâ

As for the **dates**, we will discuss them in one of the first lectures.
