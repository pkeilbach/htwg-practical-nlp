# Exam

## Basic Information

Here is some basic information about the exam:

- The exam will contain a section about each [lecture topic](https://pkeilbach.github.io/htwg-practical-nlp/lectures/preface/).
- Each lecture will be represented by approximately 5 questions, corresponding to approximately 10 points per lecture.
- The questions are a mix of multiple choice, true/false, and open questions.
- Open questions will require only short answers (1-2 sentences).
- You won't need to write any code in the exam, but you should be able to understand and explain code snippets.
- You won't need to memorize any formulas, but you should understand the concepts and be able to apply them.
- You are allowed to use a standard calculator during the exam.
- You won't need to memorize parts of the script by heart, but you should be able to explain the concepts in your own words.
- During preparation, try to focus on understanding the key concepts.
- The examples throughout the script will be helpful for understanding the concepts.

## Grade Scale

The maximium number of points you can reach in the exam is 100.

To calculate your grade points, the bonus points you earned throughout the semester will be added to your exam points:

$$
\text{Grade Points} = \text{Exam Points} + \text{Bonus Points}
$$

| Grade Points | Grade |
| ------------ | ----- |
| $\geq 95$    | $1.0$ |
| $\geq 90$    | $1.3$ |
| $\geq 85$    | $1.7$ |
| $\geq 80$    | $2.0$ |
| $\geq 75$    | $2.3$ |
| $\geq 70$    | $2.7$ |
| $\geq 65$    | $3.0$ |
| $\geq 60$    | $3.3$ |
| $\geq 55$    | $3.7$ |
| $\geq 50$    | $4.0$ |

!!! example

    Assuming you reach 83 points in the exam, and earned 7 bonus points throughout the semester,
    your grade points would be 90. This would result in a grade of 1.3 (instead of 2.0).

!!! note

    If you exceed 100 points with your bonus points, the grade points will be capped at 100.
