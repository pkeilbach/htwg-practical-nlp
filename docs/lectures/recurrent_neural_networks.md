# Sequence Models

Another section title could be "Other Model Architectures" or "Sequence Models".

Course 3: RNN basics & Vanishing Gradient Problem -> LSTM

https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp/home/week/1

## from N-Grams to RNNs

- N-Grams: fixed size context window
- RNNs: variable size context window

## RNNs

- cost function

## Math in RNNs

- RNNs as a chain of sort???

- scan function (implementation)

## Bi-directional RNNs

## Vanishing Gradient Problem

## LSTMs
