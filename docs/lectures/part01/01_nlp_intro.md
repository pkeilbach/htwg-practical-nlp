## NLP Real World Applications

Here are some core applications of NLP in our everyday lives:

- A modern **smartphone** basically is an NLP swiss army knife and already contains a lot of NLP applications:
    - speech recogntion, aka "Speech-to-Text" (STT) when dictating messages,
    - auto-correction or auto-completion when typing, or
    - voice assistants, e.g. [Siri](https://www.apple.com/de/siri/) or [Bixby](https://www.samsung.com/de/apps/bixby/).

- If you use a common **email application** like [Gmail](https://www.google.com/intl/de/gmail/about/) or [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/), chances are you make use of features that are based on NLP techniques, e.g:
    - spam filters,
    - calendar event extraction, or
    - priority inbox.

- **Voice-based assistants** like [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/de-DE/alexa) or [Siri](https://www.apple.com/de/siri/) utilize a variety of NLP techniques to interact with its users, i.e. they need to understand user commands and questions, and reply accordingly using Text-to-Speech (TTS).

- Modern **search engines** like [Google](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/) or [Bing](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-bing-delivers-search-results-d18fc815-ac37-4723-bc67-9229ce3eb6a3) make heavy use of NLP for a variety of subtasks, such as understanding the user query, autocompletion, or ranking and grouping the query results.

There are many more **domain-sprecific applications od NLP**, and the following list is by no means exhaustive:

- Companies use NLP to analyze their **social media channels** in order to understand customer needs.
- On **e-Commerce platforms**, NLP is used to understand customer reviews or make recommendations.
- In some domains, NLP is used for automated **report generation**, e.g. for weather forecasting or financial reports.
- Tools like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/how-does-grammarly-work/) or MS Office use NLP for **spell checking and grammar correction**
- In the domain of **learning and assessment**, NLP is used e.g. for plagiarism detection, intelligent tutoring systems ("MOOCS"), or language learning apps

!!! question

    Based on your personal **working experience**, where have you already encountered, or can think of, potential **NLP applications**?

## NLP Tasks

- **Language modelling**:
- **Text classification**:
- **Information extraction**:
- **Information retrieval**: 
- **Conversational agent**: 
- **Text summarization**: 
- **Question answering**: 
- **Machine translation**: 
- **Topic modeling**: 

!!! info

    An **NLP application** is usually use-case driven, ie.e it has a specific goal in mind or provides added value to its users. It utilizies one or more **NLP tasks** to achieve that goal.


## Building Blocks of Language

## Challenges in NLP

## NLP meets Artificial Intelligence

### Heuristic-Based NLP

### Machine Learning for NLP

### Deep Learning for NLP

**Why Deep Learning is not yet the Silver Bullet for NLP?**


## Key Takeaways
- to better understand NLP and its challendes, we need to have a basic understanding of what language is, especially its building block: phonemes, morphemes & lexemes, syntax, and context
- AI plays a crucial role in modern NLP applications, but not every NLP application requires AI. There are multiple approaches to achieve the several NLP tasks (e.g. regex, rule-based) (TODO)
