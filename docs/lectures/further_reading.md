# Where to go from here?

This a collection of resources that may be interesting for you if you want to dive deeper into NLP, LLMs and related topics.

## DeepLearning.AI

[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) offers a variety of courses on deep learning. The courses are taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/), one of the most influential researchers in the field of machine learning and an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University’s Computer Science Department. The courses are available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

Their [specializations](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/) are a great way to deep dive into a specific topic and consist of one or more courses. They require a time commitment of 2-4 months and cost around 40-80€ per month. Here are some of the specializations that may be interesting for you:

- [Natural Language Processing](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/natural-language-processing-specialization/)
- [Generative AI with LLMs](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/)

They also offer some easily digestable [short courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/) on specific topics. Here are some that some especially interesting as a follow-up to this course:

- [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)
- [Building Systems with the ChatGPT API](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-systems-with-chatgpt/)
- [LangChain: Chat with Your Data](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/)
- [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/)
- [Finetuning Large Language Models](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/finetuning-large-language-models/)
- [LLMOps](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/llmops/)
- [Automated Testing for LLMOps](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/automated-testing-llmops/)

## Microsoft

Microsoft offers a variety of courses on any technology related topic. They also offer some courses on AI and LLMs, mostly related to their own products (e.g. Azure). The courses are available on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/). Here are some of the courses that may be interesting for you:

- [Coursera: Natural Language Processing in Microsoft Azure](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-microsoft-azure)
- [Understand the Transformer architecture and explore large language models in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-foundation-models-in-model-catalog/)
- [Get started with prompt flow to develop Large Language Model (LLM) apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-prompt-flow/)

## Google

Also Google has great learning resources available on [Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths). Their [Generative AI for Developers Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/183) sounds especially interesting.

## Podcasts

- Lex Fridman's [Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) is a podcast about AI, deep learning, science, and technology. He interviews some of the most interesting people in the field of AI and machine learning, like [Sam Altman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Guz73e6fw), [Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jspaMLxBig), or [Yann LeCun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGSOCuByo24).
- In his episode with [Dario Amodei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4) (CEO of Anthropic, the company that created Claude, one of the best AI systems in the world) they talk about scaling, safety, regulation, and a lot of technical details about the present and future of AI and humanity.

## Related fields of study

- **Search and Information Retrieval:** Search is a very interesting field of study that is closely related to NLP. It is about finding relevant information in a large corpus of documents. The [Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html) book written by Stanford University professors is a great resource to learn more about this topic.

- **Healthcare:** NLP is also used in healthcare to extract information from medical records, like diagnoses, symptoms, or medications. This information can be used to improve patient care, reduce costs, or predict diseases. The [Natural Language Processing in Healthcare](https://www.coursera.org/learn/clinical-natural-language-processing) course on Coursera is a great resource to learn more about this topic, or more generally, the [AI for Medicine Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-for-medicine-specialization/) by DeepLearning.AI.

- **Recommendation Systems:** Recommendation systems are used to recommend products, movies, or music to users. They are based on the idea that users with similar preferences will also like similar products. The [Recommender Systems Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems) by the University of Minnesota is a great resource to learn more about this topic.

- **Legal:** NLP is also used in the legal domain to extract information from legal documents, like contracts, or to predict the outcome of a case. Here is a short [article](https://intellisoft.io/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-the-law-industry-key-trends-examples-usages/) about this topic.

## Talks and Conferences

- [TED Talk: How AI could empower any business](https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_ng_how_ai_could_empower_any_business?hss_channel=lcp-18246783) by Andrew Ng
