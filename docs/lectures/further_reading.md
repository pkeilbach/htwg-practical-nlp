# Where to go from here?

This a collection of resources that may be interesting for you if you want to dive deeper into NLP, LLMs and related topics.

## DeepLearning.AI

[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) offers a variety of courses on deep learning. The courses are taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/), one of the most influential researchers in the field of machine learning and an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University’s Computer Science Department. The courses are available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

Their [specializations](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/) are a great way to deep dive into a specific topic and consist of one or more courses. They require a time commitment of 2-4 months and cost around 40-80€ per month. Here are some of the specializations that may be interesting for you:

- [Natural Language Processing](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/natural-language-processing-specialization/)
- [Generative AI with LLMs](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/)

They also offer some easily digestable [short courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/) on specific topics. Here are some that some especially interesting as a follow-up to this course:

- [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)
- [Building Systems with the ChatGPT API](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-systems-with-chatgpt/)
- [LangChain: Chat with Your Data](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/)
- [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/)
- [Finetuning Large Language Models](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/finetuning-large-language-models/)
- [LLMOps](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/llmops/)
- [Automated Testing for LLMOps](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/automated-testing-llmops/)

## Microsoft

Microsoft offers a variety of courses on any technology related topic. They also offer some courses on AI and LLMs, mostly related to their own products (e.g. Azure). The courses are available on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/). Here are some of the courses that may be interesting for you:

- [Understand the Transformer architecture and explore large language models in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-foundation-models-in-model-catalog/)
- [Get started with prompt flow to develop Large Language Model (LLM) apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-prompt-flow/)

## Google

Also Google has great learning resources available on [Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths). Their [Generative AI for Developers Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/183) sounds especially interesting.

## Podcasts

- Lex Fridman's [Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) is podcast about AI, deep learning, science, and technology. He interviews some of the most interesting people in the field of AI and machine learning, like [Sam Altman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Guz73e6fw), [Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jspaMLxBig), or [Yann LeCun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGSOCuByo24).
