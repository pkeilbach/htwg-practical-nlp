# Prerequisites

The following skills are **recommended** to participate in the course.

## Basic Programming Skills

To complete the course, you will need basic programming skills.
If you visited an introduction to programming course, you should be good to go.

!!! info

    I tried to design the coding exercises in a way that students with little programming experience can solve them.
    If you know your basics about object oriented programming, you will be well equipped.
    Any advanced concpets will be explained during the lecture.
    In the end, we don't want to bother with advanced programming concepts but get excited with NLP!
    So don't worry if you just started your programming journey, you are still encouraged to take the course!

## Basic Python Skills

The code for this lecture is written in Python, so it is definetely an advantage if you have worked with Python before.
However, if you are coming from a different langugage, you should be able to follow along.
I tried to keep the language specific parts to a minimum and will provide explanations where necessary.

!!! tip

    Microsoft provides a nice [beginner Python course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/beginner-python/) that you can take to get up to speed.

## Knowledge of the Linux Command Line

Since the course is designed for a Linux development environment, it is recommended to have some basic skills with the Linux command line, i.e. the bash shell.
However, all required commands will be provided in the instructions, so it is not necessary to have extensive Linux command line skills.

!!! tip

    Here is a basic [bash tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/bash-introduction/) which may help if you are new to Linux.

!!! info

    We use `make` commands to automate the setup process and simplify the commands. You can check out the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/blob/main/Makefile) to see what is actucally executed. If you have not used a `Makefile` before, you may find [this tuorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/) helpful.

## Basic Knowledge of Git

The course material is hosted on GitHub pages and you can access it through the browser.
As for the assignments, you will need to clone the repository and set up the development environment.
Since the course is under continuous development, you will need to pull the latest changes from time to time.

!!! tip

    Here is a [Git tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/intro-to-vc-git/) that you should complete in case you have not worked with git before. If you are new to GitHub, you might want to check out [this module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github/).
