# Course Profile

## Description

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on both basic methods and modern techniques. Students will explore essential topics such as preprocessing, feature extraction, and classic algorithms like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, used for text classification. Core concepts in language modeling and vector space models will be covered, including Minimum Edit Distance for text similarity.

Later in the course, students will delve into advanced NLP approaches, including word embeddings and sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their improvements with attention mechanisms. The course balances theory and practical application, preparing students to build and understand NLP systems in real-world contexts. Towards the end of the course, we will also touch on large language models, prompt engineering, and generative AI.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the **fundamentals** of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its key applications.
- Apply various preprocessing techniques and feature extraction methods to **text data**.
- Analyze and implement basic models for **text classification**, such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
- Understand and utilize **advanced NLP techniques**, including word embeddings and sequence models.
- Explore the **concepts** behind large language models, prompt engineering, and generative AI.

## Assessment

The course is graded based on a **written 90-minute exam** at the end of the semester.
To be admitted to the exam, you need to complete the [assignmnets](../assignments.md) and give a [presentation](../presentations/presentations.md).
You can earn **bonus points** for the exam through [contributions](https://github.com/pkeilbach/htwg-practical-nlp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the course repository (TBD).
