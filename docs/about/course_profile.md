# Course Profile

## Objectives

This course aims to provide students with a foundational understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and techniques.
By the end of this course, students will be equipped to preprocess text data, engineer relevant features, and apply basic machine learning models on text data.
Additionally, students will gain insights into advanced NLP concepts like large language models and generative AI, along with their practical applications.

## Contents

## Assessment

The course is graded based on a **written 90-minute exam** at the end of the semester.
To be admitted to the exam, it is required to

- complete all assignments and
- give a presentation on an NLP topic.

The presentation and assignments are ungraded.

## Course Language

All course materials are provided in English.
Lectures will be held in German unless we have international students.
In this case, the lectures will also be in English.

## Course Format
