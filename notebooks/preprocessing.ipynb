    "The task is completed successfully if all tests for the first assignment pass.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "make assignment_1\n",

    "> As you can check in the `Makefile`, this is will execute `pytest tests/htwgnlp/test_preprocessing.py` under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have the following requirements for the preprocessing pipeline of our tweets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- remove URLs as they are usually shortened and don't add much information to the tweet\n",
    "- remove hashtag symbols `#` but preserve the word of the hashtag since it gives valuable information about the content of the tweet\n",
    "- remove english stopwords\n",
    "- remove standard punctuation, but keep emojis like `:)`\n",
    "- Twitter handles like `@stuartthull` should be removed completely\n",
    "- after preprocessing, it is expected to have the tweet in a tokenized and stemmed for, i.e. a list of words.\n",
    "- for tokenization, you should use [NLTK's `TweetTokenizer`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.casual.html#nltk.tokenize.casual.TweetTokenizer)\n",
    "- for stemming, you should use [`NLTK's PorterStemmer`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.stem.porter.html)\n",
    "- Also, tweets should be lowercased and repeated character sequences should not be more than 3, e.g. `looooove` should be transformed to `looove`\n",
