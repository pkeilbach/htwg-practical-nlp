    "# Auto Correct with Minimum Edit Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement a simple auto-correct system. We will use the Minimum Edit Distance algorithm to measure the similarity between a word and a target word. Then, we will use this to find the word in our vocabulary that is most similar to the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement models that correct words that are 1 and 2 edit distances away. \n",
    "\n",
    "An edit could consist of one of the following options: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Delete (remove a letter): `hat` => `at, ha, ht`\n",
    "- Switch (swap 2 adjacent letters): `eta` => `eat, tea,...`\n",
    "- Replace (change 1 letter to another): `jat` => `hat, rat, cat, mat, ...`\n",
    "- Insert (add a letter): `te` => `the, ten, ate, ...`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using the four methods above to implement an Auto-correct. \n",
    "- To do so, you will need to compute probabilities that a certain word is correct given an input. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This auto-correct you are about to implement was first created by [Peter Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) in 2007. His [original article](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) may be a useful reference for this notebook."
